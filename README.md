# HelloUnity.js
UnityScript file which can act as a "Hello world" script, and is the lyrics to the song "HelloUnity.js" from the album Unite in the Sky.
The song can be downloaded from the [Unity-chan website](http://unity-chan.com/) under Data Download -> Sound -> キャラクターソング・アルバム Vol.1「UNITE IN THE SKY」 (Image Album Vol.1)

Note: I did not originally write this. I simply wrote out in text format the lyrics provided in the booklet image.
Note2: This script will not work in modern versions of Unity as UnityScript support has been dropped. The script produces errors in the latest version of 2017.2 which is all I tested. I will try to test in older versions of Unity later.
